Abstract
Background: Mobile technologies could be a powerful media for providing individual level support to health care
consumers. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions delivered to
health care consumers.
Methods and Findings: We searched for all controlled trials of mobile technology-based health interventions delivered to
health care consumers using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, UK NHS HTA (Jan
1990–Sept 2010). Two authors extracted data on allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of
follow-up, and measures of effect. We calculated effect estimates and used random effects meta-analysis. We identified 75
trials. Fifty-nine trials investigated the use of mobile technologies to improve disease management and 26 trials investigated
their use to change health behaviours. Nearly all trials were conducted in high-income countries. Four trials had a low risk of
bias. Two trials of disease management had low risk of bias; in one, antiretroviral (ART) adherence, use of text messages
reduced high viral load (.400 copies), with a relative risk (RR) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.72–0.99), but no statistically significant benefit
on mortality (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.47–1.32]). In a second, a PDA based intervention increased scores for perceived self care agency
in lung transplant patients. Two trials of health behaviour management had low risk of bias. The pooled effect of text
messaging smoking cessation support on biochemically verified smoking cessation was (RR 2.16 [95% CI 1.77–2.62]).
Interventions for other conditions showed suggestive benefits in some cases, but the results were not consistent. No evidence
of publication bias was demonstrated on visual or statistical examination of the funnel plots for either disease management or
health behaviours. To address the limitation of the older search, we also reviewed more recent literature.
Conclusions: Text messaging interventions increased adherence to ART and smoking cessation and should be considered
for inclusion in services. Although there is suggestive evidence of benefit in some other areas, high quality adequately
powered trials of optimised interventions are required to evaluate effects on objective outcomes.

M-health Technology Interventions for Lay People
The features of mobile technologies that may make them
particularly appropriate for providing individual level support to
health care consumers relate to their popularity, their mobility,
and their technological capabilities. The popularity of mobile
technologies has led to high and increasing ownership of mobile
technologies, which means interventions can be delivered to large
numbers of people. In 2009, more than two-thirds of the world’s
population owned a mobile phone and 4.2 trillion text messages
were sent [15]. In many high-income countries, the number of
mobile phone subscriptions outstrips the population [16]. In lowincome countries, mobile communication technology is the fastest
growing sector of the communications industry and geographical
coverage is high [17–20].
Mobile technologies are mobile and popular, such that many
people carry their mobile phone with them wherever they go. This
allows temporal synchronisation of the intervention delivery and
allows the intervention to claim people’s attention when it is most
relevant. For example, health care consumers can be sent
messages designed to sustain their motivation to quit smoking
throughout the day. Temporal synchronisation of the intervention
delivery also allows interventions to be accessed or delivered
within the relevant context, i.e., the intervention can be delivered
at any time and extra support can be requested wherever and
whenever it is needed. For example smokers trying to quit can
send text messages requesting extra support while they are
experiencing cravings due to withdrawal from nicotine, or those
with asthma can access advice regarding how to increase the use of
inhalers during an exacerbation of asthma.
The technological capabilities of mobile technologies are
continuing to advance at a high pace. Current technological
capabilities allow low cost interventions. There are potential
economies of scale as it is technically easy to deliver interventions
to large populations (for example, mobile technology applications
can easily be downloaded and automated systems can deliver text
messages to large numbers of people at low cost). The
technological functions that have been utilised for health care
consumers include text messages (SMS), software applications, and
multiple media (SMS, photos) interventions. The technology
supports interactivity, which allows people to obtain extra help
when needed [21,22]. Motivational messages, monitoring, and
behaviour change tools used in face-to-face support can be
modified for delivery via mobile phones. Interventions can be
personalised with the content tailored to the age, sex, and ethnic
group of the participant or to the issues they face [21,22].
Existing systematic reviews of M-health interventions focus on
the application of specific devices (e.g., mobile phones [23–27],
specific mobile technology functions (e.g., text messaging [28–30]),
or individual diseases or types of illness (e.g., diabetes care or
chronic disease management [26,30,31]). These reviews require
updating. Some types of interventions for health care consumers
targeting healthy behaviour or disease management have not been
covered by previous reviews. A comprehensive review of
interventions delivered to health care consumers is lacking and
provides a valuable overview of the existing evidence.
This systematic review aimed to quantify the effectiveness of
mobile technology-based interventions delivered to health care
consumers for health behaviour change and management of
diseases.
Introduction
Each year, worldwide, over 22 million people die from diseases
such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, HIV, lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus [1]. The majority
of deaths (83%) occur in low- and middle-income countries;
however, these are also important causes of mortality in highincome countries, accounting for about 39% of deaths [1].
Health care consumers adopting healthy behaviours can
prevent the onset of many of these leading causes of mortality.
Ten years after stopping smoking, the risk of lung cancer is half of
that of those continuing smoking and 15 y after stopping smoking
the risk of cardiovascular disease is similar to that of those who
never smoked [2]. HIV can be prevented by adopting safer sexual
practices [3]. In people who are overweight, weight loss can
reduce the incidence of diabetes [4].
Optimal treatment of existing diseases can also reduce mortality
and morbidity. In patients with existing coronary heart disease
long term anti-platelet therapy reduces major vascular events
(myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular mortality) by about a
quarter [5], ACE inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality by
just under a fifth [6], beta blockers reduce mortality by almost a
quarter [7], and lipid lowering therapy reduces coronary mortality
by about a fifth [8]. Antiretroviral medication delays the
progression of HIV infection [9]. Good control of diabetes
reduces the onset of retinopathy by half and reduces the onset of
nephropathy by two-thirds [10].
Optimal treatment of existing diseases requires the involvement
of health care consumers in managing aspects of their disease.
Health care consumers decide whether to adhere to prescribed
medication and determine when they seek health care [11].
Involving health care consumers in self-management of diseases
such as in monitoring their health/disease status and adjusting
their medication dosage (e.g., insulin or asthma medications) can
improve health outcomes [12–14].
An important function of health care services is therefore to
encourage and support health care consumers to adopt healthy
behaviours and to self-manage chronic diseases. However, the
amount of information, encouragement, and support that can be
conveyed during consultations, within existing service infrastructures or through other traditional media (such as leaflets), is limited.
Mobile technologies are a means for providing individual level
support to health care consumers. Mobile health interventions for
health care consumers have been designed to increase healthy
behaviour (for example, to increase smoking cessation or activity
levels) or improve disease management (for example, by increasing
adherence to prescribed medication, improving management of
diabetes or asthma, or delivering therapeutic interventions).
Mobile technologies include mobile phones; personal digital
assistants (PDAs) and PDA phones (e.g., BlackBerry, Palm Pilot);
smartphones (e.g., iPhone); enterprise digital assistants (EDAs);
portable media players (i.e., MP3-players, MP4-players, e.g., ipod);
handheld video-game consoles (e.g., Playstation Portable [PSP],
Nintendo DS); handheld and ultra-portable computers such as
tablet PCs (e.g., iPad), and Smartbooks.
These devices have a range of functions from mobile cellular
communication using text messages (SMS), photos and video
(MMS), telephone, and World Wide Web access, to multi-media
playback and software application support. Technological advances and improved computer processing power mean that single
mobile devices such as smart phones and PDA phones are
increasingly capable of high level performance in many or all of
these functions.

Methods
We adhered to our published plan of investigation as outlined in
the study protocol [32].

M-health Technology Interventions for Lay People
Michie’s taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [34]. Risk of
bias was assessed according to the criteria outlined by the
International Cochrane Collaboration [35]. We assessed blinding
of outcome assessors and data analysts and we used a cut off of
90% complete follow-up for low risk of bias for completeness of
follow-up. We contacted study authors for additional information
about the included studies, or for clarification of the study methods
as required.
All analyses were conducted in STATA v 11. We calculated risk
ratios and standard mean differences. We used random effects
meta-analysis to give pooled estimates where there were two or
more trials using the same mobile technology function (e.g., SMS
messages) and targeting the same disease (e.g., diabetes control) or
behaviour (e.g., activity) and reporting the same outcome. We
examined heterogeneity visually by examining the forest plots and
statistically using both the x2 test and the I2 statistic. We assessed
evidence of publication bias using Funnel plots.
Participants were men and women of any age. We included all
controlled trials employing any mobile technology interventions
(mobile phones; PDAs and PDA phones [e.g., BlackBerry, Palm
Pilot]; smartphones [e.g., iphone]; enterprise digital assistants
[EDAs]; portable media players [i.e., MP3-players and MP4players, e.g., ipod]; handheld video-game consoles [e.g., Playstation Portable (PSP), Nintendo DS]; handheld and ultra-portable
computers such as tablet PCs [e.g., ipad and Smartbooks]) to
improve or promote health or health service use or quality. Trials
were included regardless of publication status or language.
We included studies in which the intervention delivered by
mobile technology was the primary intervention component under
evaluation. We excluded studies evaluating either mixed mobile
technology and non-mobile technology based interventions in
which the treatment and control group both received the mobile
technology-based component or interventions in which treatments
between the treatment and control groups differed in additional
ways besides the components delivered by mobile technology, such
as interventions involving face-to-face counselling with a text
message intervention compared to a control group receiving
information only. We included trials of immunisation reminders;
trials of general appointment reminders are reported elsewhere
[33].
The interventions in trials meeting the inclusion criteria and
targeting health behaviour change or disease management
interventions for health care consumers are reported here. Other
trials identified targeted data collection or health care delivery
processes, such as those directed to health care providers (e.g., for
diagnosis and management) or those involving communication
between health care services and health care consumers (e.g.,
appointment reminders, test result notification). These are
reported in two separate articles [33]. No trial was excluded from
the review based on the type of health or health care service
targeted.
Primary outcomes were defined as any objective measure of
health or health service delivery or use. Secondary outcomes were
defined as the following: self-reported outcomes related to health
behaviours, disease management, health service delivery or use,
and cognitive outcomes. Outcomes reported for any length of
follow-up were included.
We searched the following electronic bibliographic databases
MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, The Cochrane
Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane
Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Cochrane
Methodology Register), NHS Health Technology Assessment
Database, and Web of Science (science and social science citation
index) from 1990 to Sept 2010 and the reference lists of included
trials. The list of subheadings (MeSH) and textwords used in the
search strategy can be found in Text S3. All of these terms were
combined with the Cochrane Library MEDLINE filter for
controlled trials of interventions.
Two reviewers independently scanned the electronic records to
identify potentially eligible trials.
Two reviewers independently extracted data on number of
randomised participants, intervention, intervention components,
mobile devices employed, mobile technology functions used,
sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome
assessors, completeness of follow-up, evidence of selective outcome
reporting, any other potential sources of bias, and measures of
effect using a standardised data extraction form. The authors were
not blinded to authorship, journal of publication, or the trial
results. All discrepancies were agreed by discussion with a third
reviewer. The behaviour change techniques used in behaviour
change interventions were classified according to Abraham and
PLOS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org
Results
The combined search strategies identified 26,221 electronic
records, which were screened for eligibility (Figure 1). The full
texts of 334 potentially eligible reports were obtained for further
assessment. Out of the 334 potentially eligible reports, 75 met the
study inclusion criteria and were trials delivered to health care
consumers; 26 interventions aimed to increase healthy behaviours,
such as stopping smoking or increasing activity, which can prevent
the onset or progression of disease (health behaviour change
interventions); and 49 targeted disease management, including
interventions designed to improve self-management of diseases like
diabetes, and therapeutic interventions, such as interventions
providing psychological support.
Characteristics of Studies
Health behaviour change. The health behaviour change
trials included 10,706 participants. Sample sizes ranged from 17 to
5,800. There were 26 randomised controlled trials with parallel
groups, and one non-randomised controlled trial. There were five
trials aiming to increase smoking cessation (Table 1), seven trials
aimed to increase physical activity (Table 2), three trials aimed to
reduce calorie intake (Table 2), seven trials aimed to increase
physical activity and reduce calorie intake (Table 2), three trials
aimed to increase safer sexual behaviour (Table 3), and one trial
aimed to reduce alcohol consumption (Table 3).
All trials were conducted in high-income countries.
Disease management. The 49 disease management trials
recruited 6,832 participants with sample sizes ranging from 16 to
273 participants. Thirty-four were randomised controlled trials
with parallel groups, three were cluster randomised controlled
trials, five were crossover trials, and seven were non-randomised
parallel group trials. Nine trials aimed to improve the management of illnesses presenting acutely. Of these nine trials, seven
provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation instruction (Table 4), one
provided the information required by a lay-helper to manage an
emergency, and one provided accident and emergency department discharge information for sprains and lacerations. For
chronic conditions six trials aimed to increase adherence to
medication (Table 5). Thirteen trials aimed to improve diabetes
control (Table 6), six aimed to improve asthma control (Table 7),
and two aimed to improve hypertension control (Table 8). Seven
interventions provided psychological support (Table 9). One trial
aimed to increase self-care behaviours in patients following a lung
transplant, one trial aimed to improve monitoring and provide
appropriate advice regarding chemotherapy-related toxicity symp3

Families attended 3 educational group sessions on increasing
physical activity, reducing sugar-sweetened beverage
consumption and screen time (computer or television). Parent
and child pairs were instructed to send 2 SMS daily to the
study team, reporting separately for the parent and child: the
number of steps taken (measured by pedometer); the number
of sugar-sweetened beverages consumed; the minutes of
screen time. Parents and children received automated
feedback messages selected from a database using an
algorithm based on the number of goals met, comparison
to the previous day. Duration: 8 wk.

the trial reports are found in Tables 11 and 12.
Disease management. Forty-two of the 49 disease management interventions were delivered by mobile phone or PDA
mobile phone with 27 using the SMS function, three using MP4
video functions, four using MP3 audio and MP4 video functions,
six using application software, one using WAP for data transfer,
and one using telephone functions. Two interventions were
delivered via PDA, three used hand held computers, one used a
video console all of which employed application software. One
used a portable media player/MP3 employing audio functions.
Outcomes
Health behaviour change. The health behaviour change
trials reported between one and 23 outcomes. Primary outcomes
were as follows: Four trials reported four different medical
outcomes such as HBA1C (n = 1), blood pressure (n = 1), and
deaths (n = 1). Fourteen trials reported seven different anthropometric outcomes (e.g., height, weight). Eight trials reported four
different objective measures of behaviour.
Secondary outcomes were as follows: Thirteen trials reported 38
different self-reported behaviour outcomes and four trials reported
seven different knowledge, cognitive, or other mediator outcomes.
Disease management. The disease management trials
reported between one and 25 outcomes. Primary outcomes were
as follows: Seventeen trials measured 28 different medical
outcomes. Three trials measured four different anthropometric
outcomes. Secondary outcomes were as follows: Thirty trials
reported 125 different medical, disease control, or medical process
outcomes such as hospitalization, cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR) skills, adherence to treatment, and self-monitoring of
disease. Eleven cognitive mediator or other mediator outcomes
were reported (such as knowledge and attitudes).
Study Quality
Health behaviour change. The assessment of study quality
is reported in Table 13 and the Cochrane risk of bias summary is
reported in Figure 2. Two trials were at low risk of bias for all
quality criteria [21,36]. No evidence of publication bias was
demonstrated on visual or statistical examination of the funnel
plots.

Effects
For each type of intervention we report primary outcomes and a

For other trials, of three smoking cessation trials reporting
biochemicallyverified smoking cessation outcomes, two showed
statistically significant improvement [36,39]. There were no
statistically or clinically significant changes in weight for trials
using SMS messages to reduce calorie intake and increase physical
activity (standard mean difference [SMD] 22.14 [95% CI 27.05
to 2.77] kg) or for trials using application software to reduce calorie
intake (SMD 20.10 [95% CI 20.49 to 0.69] kg). One trial of a
diet and physical activity intervention and one other trial of an
intervention targeting diet only showed statistically significant
reductions in waist circumference [40,41]. The other 13 anthropometric outcomes for trials targeting physical activity only, diet
only, or diet and physical activity showed no statistically significant
effects (Table 18). One trial [42] targeting physical activity
reported four disease control outcomes: one showed a statistically
significant benefit in diabetes control (HBA1C) [42], one showed
no effect on insulin requirements [42], and two showed no change
in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. One objective measure of
physical activity showed a statistically significant increase in the
number of steps taken per day as assessed by a pedometer. There
were no primary outcomes reported for sexual health or alcohol
consumption [42].
Secondary outcomes. Table 15 shows the effect estimates
for secondary outcomes for health behaviour change interventions.
For smoking cessation support, eight of the 14 self-reported
smoking outcomes showed statistically significant benefits and
none showed statistically significant harms. For physical activity,
diet, and diet and physical activity trials, seven of the 14 selfreported physical activity outcomes reported showed statistically
significant benefits and none showed statistically significant harms.
None of the 17 dietary intake outcomes reported showed
statistically significant effects. There were six reported outcomes
regarding cognitive mediators of behaviour change. Of these,
three showed statistically significant benefits and none showed
statistically significant harms. For the trial targeting safer sexual
behaviour, the cognitive mediator of behaviour change (selfefficacy regarding condom use) reported showed a statistically
significant benefit.

Data capture and reporting was carried out using
a hand-held computer. Essential data required
from both groups included: date of infusion,
purpose, site of bleeding (if any), factor
concentrate lot number(s), and number of vials.
Data for each infusion were transmitted at the
touch of a button to a server at the haemophilia

Secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes are reported in
Tables 16 and 17.
One trial at low risk of bias was an adherence intervention that
reduced self-reported non adherence to antiretroviral medication
(RR 0.80 [95% CI 0.69–0.94]).The other trial with low risk of bias
reported an increase in self care agency in patients with lung
transplants [38].
Other trials included SMS reminders that had no effect on the
percentage of pills taken daily in two trials (RR 1.00 [95% CI
0.77–1.30]) with I2 = 0%. Of six other adherence outcomes
reported by four trials, three showed statistically significant
benefits and none showed statistically significant harms. In one
trial, the pooled effect of SMS reminders on attendance for
vaccination at different time points was RR 1.19 (95% CI 1.15–
1.23) with I2 = 99.7% (p.0.001). For cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), of 37 outcomes reported in nine trials, 18 showed
statistically significant benefits and none showed statistically
significant reductions in the quality of CPR. For diabetes selfmanagement interventions, of 26 medical process outcomes
reported, five showed statistically significant benefits and two
showed statistically significant reductions in beneficial medical
processes. Of 11 cognitive or mediator outcomes, five showed
significant reduction [48] and none showed statistically significant
negative effects. There were no statistically significant effects
reported for a trial for monitoring of heart failure. For antenatal
support there were no statistically significant effects reported for
five outcomes reported in one trial [49].

effects are small and of borderline clinical importance. Simple
medication reminders delivered by SMS message show no
benefits. The effect estimates for diet and diet with physical
activity interventions on weight were consistent with no or small
benefits. There is suggestive evidence of benefit for reminders for
vaccine appointment attendance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. There is suggestive evidence of short-term benefits
for interventions for asthma control, physical activity, and
psychological support interventions, which could be clinically
important if these effects were demonstrated in the long term. Our
review found that few trials were at low risk of bias in all areas
assessed. Few trials were conducted in low- or middle-income
countries.
statistically significant benefits and none showed statistically
significant harms. For hypertension, of three self-monitoring
outcomes, none had statistically significant effects and one of
two quality of life outcomes showed a statistically significant
benefit. One of two anxiety outcomes showed a statistically
significant benefit and there was no effect on self-reported
adherence to hypertension medication. There were no statistically
significant effects on 19 outcomes relating to chemotherapy
symptom monitoring. One lung transplant monitoring intervention reported a statistically significant increase in perceived selfcare agency. For one trial of ante-natal support, four of the six
outcomes regarding anxiety, confidence, and satisfaction showed
statistically significant benefits and none showed statistically
significant harms. For psychological support interventions, three
of the seven anxiety outcomes showed statistically significant
reductions in anxiety and five of the nine other outcomes showed
statistically significant benefits. There were no statistically significant reductions reported in psychological health outcomes.
Strengths and weaknesses of the systematic review in
relation to other systematic reviews. To our knowledge, this
is the first systematic review of all mobile technology interventions
delivered to health care consumers. Our review updates earlier
reviews and expands them either by using a more exhaustive
search strategy, by presenting effect estimates and 95% confidence
intervals for all reported outcomes [28,29,31], or by conducting
meta-analysis, where sufficient trials report similar outcomes
[28,29,31]. Nineteen trials (25%) did not provide sufficient data
to calculate effect estimates and authors did not respond to
requests for data; this could have resulted in bias in the systematic
review findings. It was beyond the scope of our review to review all
internet or video-based interventions, which in principal can be
viewed on many modern mobile phones. Our review aimed to
examine the effects of interventions delivered by mobile technologies alone, so we excluded interventions combining mobile
technologies with other interventions such as face-to-face counselling. These interventions could be subject to a separate
systematic review. A wide range of factors could influence the
effectiveness of mobile technology interventions including trial
quality [50]; participant factors such as demographics (gender/
age) or disease status (disease management/disease prevention
interventions); the setting (low-/middle- or high-income country),
intervention factors such as components, intensity, timing, type of
mobile device (e.g., PDA or mobile phone); or the mobile
Discussion
Key Findings
This review of randomised controlled trials for mobile
technology interventions delivered to health care consumers found
59 trials that investigated the use of mobile technologies to
improve disease management and 26 trials that investigated their
use to change health behaviours. The trial demonstrated mixed
evidence regarding the benefits of interventions, and nearly all
trials were conducted in high-income countries. Four trials had a
low risk of bias. One trial with low risk of bias reported clinically
important reductions in viral load from an intervention that used
text messages to maintain contact, monitor, and respond to
medication issues with patients prescribed antiretrovirals in Kenya
[37]. Trials demonstrate that automated multifaceted smoking
cessation support delivered by text message more than doubles
biochemically verified smoking cessation [21,36]. However, our
meta-analyses show that, to date, mobile technology-based
interventions for diabetes control that have statistically significant

technology function used (e.g., SMS, video, application software).
It was not possible to explore the factors influencing heterogeneity
statistically, as there were few trials of similar interventions
reporting the same outcomes, resulting in limited power for such
analyses. The examination of funnel plots in exploring publication
bias was limited. as few trials contributed to some pooled analyses.
We used Abraham and Michie’s typology [34] of behaviour
change tools to code the intervention content according to author
descriptions in the papers or protocols. The typology could be
improved by modifying it for mobile technology-based interventions and specific behavioural domains, as has been done for
smoking cessation [51]. We coded the authors’ descriptions of the
interventions as reported in the papers, which varied in the level of
detail provided. The coding of intervention content would have
been more complete and accurate if the text message and other
intervention content was obtained and directly coded, as has been
done for the txt2stop intervention [51]. There was inadequate
power to explore the impact of different behaviour change tools in
specific behavioural domains on effect estimates.
Secondary outcomes were as follows: One trial reported
pregnant smokers receiving text messages were more likely to set
a quit date [59]. One trial reported a reduction in portion sizes for
a mobile phone and web based planning intervention designed to
reduce weight [60]. One trial reported an increase in testing for
HIV in those receiving a text message intervention involving ten or
more messages [61]. One trial reported increases in sexually
transmitted infection testing amongst those receiving text message
based sexual health interventions (odds ratio [OR] 2.51 [95% CI
1.11–5.69]) [62]. One factorial trial reported a reduction in sexual
partners in participants receiving safer sex text messages, but no
effects of sun protection messages on hat wearing [63]. One trial
reported an increase in condom use with ‘‘risky partners such as
sex workers or with other men’’ [64]. One trial reported a
reduction in self-reported heavy drinking days in young people
allocated to a text messages-based intervention [65].
Disease Management
We identified 37 new trials of disease management interventions. Primary outcomes were as follows: One trial with unclear
risk of bias reported improved cure rates for tuberculosis in those
receiving medication reminders [66]. One trial employing text
messages increased the proportion of urban women delivering
with a skilled attendant (OR 5.73 [95% CI 1.51–21.81]); the risk
of bias in this trial was unclear [67]. One small trial reported a
statistically and clinically important .1% absolute reduction in
HBA1C in the intervention group compared to control group
[68].Four trials of a diabetes care intervention, three involving text
messages and the other involving video messages, reported
statistically significant decreases in HBA1C, which were of
borderline clinical significance [69–73]. One trial with unclear
risk of bias reported increases in receipt of vaccinations in those
allocated to receive text messages reminders [74]. One trial found
no effect of a detailed text message compared to a simple text
message inviting women for mammography screening [75]. One
trial with unclear/high risk of bias reported an improvement in
cardiovascular risk profiles for patients receiving telemonitoring
via mobile phone with text message-based advice (RR = 1.4; 95%
CI 1.1–1.7). The intervention increased the proportion of patients
Systematic review findings in relation to findings from
trials published since our search was completed. On 1
November 2012, we re-ran our search to identify new trials
published since the search conducted for the systematic review was
completed.
Health Behaviour Change
We identified 14 new trials of health behaviour change
interventions. Primary outcomes were as follows: One trial
reported increases in smoking cessation at 1 wk for mobile
phone-based telephone counselling intervention [52]. A trial
involving video-based smoking cessation support showed no
benefits [53]. Three trials reported no statistically significant
effects on weight of a diary-plus-mobile-phone daily feedback
messages compared to a diary [54], a text message based
intervention [55], and a twitter, podcast, and mobile phone
application based intervention [56]. A mobile phone-based
counselling intervention had no effect on postponing subsequent
pregnancies on teen mothers [57]. There was no effect on plaque
score of text message based oral health education [58].

achieving blood pressure ,140/90 (RR 1.4 [1.1–1.9]) and
increased the proportion of patients achieving HBA1C of ,7%
(RR 1.16 [1.6–2.4]), but there were no statistically significant
differences in LDL cholesterol or smoking [76]. One trial with
unclear risk of bias reported a statistically significant reduction in
systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to baseline in an
intervention group receiving monitoring of salt excretion but no
statistically significant change in the control group [77]. Two trials
reported no statistically significant beneficial effects of either a text
message-based intervention or a mobile phone-based monitoring
and feedback intervention on asthma control [78,79]. A trial
providing asthma patients with alerts regarding health risk weather
forecast had no statistically significant benefits on reducing
exacerbations of asthma [80].
Secondary outcomes were as follows: Three trials reported
statistically significant increases in adherence to antiretroviral
medication with text message reminders [81–83], and one trial
PLOS Medicine | www.plosmedicine.org
reported increases in adherence that were not statistically
significant [84]. One trial has demonstrated improved quality of
life for patients with heart failure receiving a mobile phone based
telemonitoring intervention [85]. Two trials reported increases in
emotional self-awareness in young people receiving risk assessment
and management of youth mental health problems: one reported
benefits in mild depressive symptoms [86,87], and another
reported that delivering cognitive behavioural therapy messages
by mobile phone was feasible and acceptable [88]. One trial
reported improved recall of goals in a trials delivering text
messages to patients undergoing brain rehabilitation [89]. One
trial reported that an educational package of text messages
increased continuation of the combined oral contraceptive pill
[90], but simple daily reminders regarding taking the combined
oral contraceptive has no effect in another trials [91]. One trial
reported an increase in self-efficacy for self-managing cystic fibrosis

smoking cessation support was effective when evaluated in the
UK. Both interventions may require some adaptation as well as
translation for use in other countries. Health services should
consider implementing similar interventions in similar settings.
The finding that simple SMS reminders for adherence to
medication have at best small effects is consistent with the findings
from existing adherence research, which has previously demonstrated that uni-faceted interventions have very modest benefits
[102–104]. Likewise, it is unsurprising that interventions delivered
by mobile technologies appear to have small effects on weight,
given the paucity of effective behavioural change interventions for
obesity [105,106].
There is currently insufficient high quality evidence of beneficial
effects on clinical outcomes to warrant implementation of
interventions for other areas of health behaviour change or selfmanagement of diseases.
retrieve an automated external defibrillator in out-of-hospital
cardiac arrest victims [93]. Three trials reported short term
increases in physical activity in those receiving a text messagebased intervention designed to increase activity [94–96]. Four
trials reported benefits in cardiopulmonary resuscitation processes
with mobile phone-based audio instructions [97], video instruction
[98], and a feedback application [99]. One trial reported
improved quality of life with a mobile phone-based asthma selfcare system [100], and another reported increases in self-reported
adherence to asthma medication [101].
In summary, while interventions using mobile technologies for
patients are a fast-moving field, the findings of many trials
published since the search for the systematic review was completed
are generally consistent with the reported results of trials in the
systematic review, particularly for primary outcomes. Trials report
benefits in adherence to antiretroviral medication and smoking
cessation; one small trial reported a significant reduction in
HBA1c for a diabetes control intervention, and there were no or
small effects of interventions on weight and no reported benefits of
daily medication reminders. There is suggestive evidence of benefit
for attendance for vaccination and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
interventions. There are short term benefits for physical activity
interventions and psychological support interventions that could
be clinically significant if sustained.
Novel trial findings published since our search for the systematic
review was completed suggest that text messages can increase the
proportion of women receiving skilled delivery in urban areas in
Kenya. There are now mixed results for asthma control
interventions, with some trials reporting benefits. There is
suggestive evidence that multifaceted adherence interventions
can increase adherence to the combined oral contraceptive pill
and TB medication resulting in increased TB cure rates. There is
suggestive evidence that a heart failure intervention can improve
quality of life and that tele-monitoring data sent by mobile
combined with text message advice can reduce blood pressure and
HBA1C. There is suggestive evidence that sexual health interventions can increase testing for HIV and sexually transmitted
infections.
Unanswered Questions and Future Research
The benefits of text message support on adherence to
antiiretrovirals and smoking cessation should be established in
high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The cost-effectiveness of
antiretroviral adherence interventions should be established. A
cost-effectiveness analysis of mobile phone text messaging interventions for smoking cessation showed that the intervention is costeffective [107]. Further high quality trials should robustly establish
the effects of multifaceted text messaging interventions on
medication adherence in other areas, TB cure rates, and on the
proportion of births with a skilled attendant at delivery in urban
areas in low- and middle-income countries. Adequately powered
high quality trials of optimised interventions are required in areas
of health behaviour change and self-management of diseases
where there is currently suggestive evidence of benefit.
In areas where, to date, interventions have shown small benefits
of borderline or no clinical importance future research should
focus on improving interventions, drawing on existing guidance for
the development of complex interventions, prior to considering
further evaluation by randomised controlled trial [108]. There is a
considerable body of existing research regarding effective face-toface interventions for self-management of diseases, and much of
this literature suggests multifaceted interventions are required
[104,109–111]. Mobile technology-based interventions for health
care consume rs developed to date may not be optimal; some are
uni-faceted and may need to incorporate additional components
Implications of the Study for Health Care Delivery
Multifaceted adherence interventions demonstrate an increase
in adherence to anti-retrovirals and a decrease in viral load when
evaluated in Kenya [37]. An automated texting intervention for

found in other effective interventions for self-management of
diseases, but modified for delivery by mobile technologies. For
health behaviour change interventions, further research is required
to elucidate the effects of different behaviour change tools on
behaviours and to explore if interventions, which include a wider
range of behaviour change tools, have greater effects.
A range of questions regarding the effects of mobile technologies
remain open to question including which functions are most
effective (SMS, video, oral instruction, application software), which
behaviour change techniques are effective, and whether the
effectiveness of interventions is influenced by setting or participant
demographics.
The majority of the research to date has been conducted in
high-income countries, so trials of interventions in low- and
middle-income countries are required, particularly in view of the
high coverage of mobile technologies in these settings.
optimised interventions on long term, clinically important
outcomes must be robustly established in randomised controlled
trials.

Conclusion
Multifaceted mobile technology text messaging interventions
have been shown to increase adherence to antiretroviral medication in a low-income setting and increase smoking cessation in a
high-income setting; these interventions should be considered for
inclusion in services in similar settings. Their effects in other
settings should be established. For other mobile technology health
interventions delivered to health care consumers. the effects of

M-health Technology Interventions for Lay People
Editors’ Summary
smoking intervention based on text messaging (txt2stop)
more than doubled biochemically verified smoking cessation. Other lower-quality trials indicated that using text
messages to encourage physical activity improved diabetes
control but had no effect on body weight. Combined diet
and physical activity text messaging interventions also had
no effect on weight, whereas interventions for other
conditions showed suggestive benefits in some but not all
cases.
Background. Every year, millions of people die from
cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and circulation),
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a long-term lung
disease), lung cancer, HIV infection, and diabetes. These
diseases are increasingly important causes of mortality (death)
in low- and middle-income countries and are responsible for
nearly 40% of deaths in high-income countries. For all these
diseases, individuals can adopt healthy behaviors that help
prevent disease onset. For example, people can lower their
risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease by maintaining a
healthy body weight, and, if they are smokers, they can reduce
their risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease by giving
up cigarettes. In addition, optimal treatment of existing
diseases can reduce mortality and morbidity (illness). Thus, in
people who are infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy
delays the progression of HIV infection and the onset of AIDS,
and in people who have diabetes, good blood sugar control
can prevent retinopathy (a type of blindness) and other
serious complications of diabetes.
What Do These Findings Mean? These findings provide
mixed evidence for the effectiveness of health intervention
delivery to health-care consumers using mobile technologies. Moreover, they highlight the need for additional highquality controlled trials of this mHealth application, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Specifically, the
demonstration that text messaging interventions increased
adherence to antiretroviral therapy in a low-income setting
and increased smoking cessation in a high-income setting
provides some support for the inclusion of these two
interventions in health-care services in similar settings.
However, the effects of these two interventions need to be
established in other settings and their cost-effectiveness
needs to be measured before they are widely implemented.
Finally, for other mobile technology–based interventions
designed to change health behaviors or to improve selfmanagement of chronic diseases, the results of this
systematic review suggest that the interventions need to
be optimized before further trials are undertaken to establish
their clinical benefits.
Why Was This Study Done? Health-care providers need
effective ways to encourage "health-care consumers" to
make healthy lifestyle choices and to self-manage chronic
diseases. The amount of information, encouragement and
support that can be conveyed to individuals during face-toface consultations or through traditional media such as
leaflets is limited, but mobile technologies such as mobile
phones and portable computers have the potential to
transform the delivery of health messages. These increasingly popular technologies—more than two-thirds of the
world’s population now owns a mobile phone—can be used
to deliver health messages to people anywhere and at the
most relevant times. For example, smokers trying to quit
smoking can be sent regular text messages to sustain their
motivation, but can also use text messaging to request extra
support when it is needed. But is "mHealth," the provision of
health-related services using mobile communication technology, an effective way to deliver health messages to
health-care consumers? In this systematic review (a study
that uses predefined criteria to identify all the research on a
given topic), the researchers assess the effectiveness of
mobile technology-based health behavior change interventions and disease management interventions delivered to
health-care consumers.

What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers
identified 75 controlled trials (studies that compare the
outcomes of people who do and do not receive an
intervention) of mobile technology-based health interventions delivered to health-care consumers that met their
predefined criteria. Twenty-six trials investigated the use of
mobile technologies to change health behaviors, 59 investigated their use in disease management, most were of low
quality, and nearly all were undertaken in high-income
countries. In one high-quality trial that used text messages to
improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIVpositive patients in Kenya, the intervention significantly
reduced the patients’ viral load but did not significantly
reduce mortality (the observed reduction in deaths may have
happened by chance). In two high-quality UK trials, a
